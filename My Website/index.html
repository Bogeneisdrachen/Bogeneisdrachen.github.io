      <h2 class="Personal"><i>An Ode To The Lost Io,</i> a haiku:</h2>
      <p>
        The summer is gone, <br>
        Io is lost forever, <br>
        Her dreams sleep again.

      <h2 class="Personal">My Personal Interests:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>My Hobbies:</strong><br>
        Where do I begin with this paragraph? I love videogames, so much in fact that I spent at least one hour <br>
        playing a match of the newest Call Of Duty, or pulling some sick kombos in Mortal Kombat, or building a <br>
        nice castle in Minecraft when I get tired of neverending action. All of the games I play want also link <br>
        with an aspiration I want to be: a streamer. For those who don't know, a streamer is a person who plays <br>
        videogames for an audience, one may be asking why would someone spend their time watching someone else  <br>
        play a videogame, if they can play it themselves, and I respond to: why do sport channels exist? To     <br>
        enetertain! Plain and simple. That's why I want to become a streamer so I can make someone's day a      <br>
        little bit brighter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>My Career:</strong><br>
        The reason why I even begun studying for my major in computer science is simply because a counselor <br>
        recommended me to take this major. At first I was oblivious as to why would I take a major that     <br>
        specialized on computers? I am pretty sure there is a saturation of programmers already, and that's <br>
        the moment I discovered how false my views were then, there is a scarcity of programmers, not only  <br>
        that, but this career can pay handsomely well, and the best part is that you can even work on your  <br>
        career before you even graduate, which is a luxury not that many majors have. Therefore, I begun to <br>
        become more interested in this field as a result, not only is a career of the future, it is the     <br>
        future, and while other fields fall, others are born, and computer science is not going away any    <br>
        time soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>My Personal Life:</strong><br>
        I have recently seen myself getting to gain a little bit more weight, which worries me a lot. I always <br>
        had this irrational fear of never being able to lose weight. The reality is that my small weight gains <br>
        are due to my diet. It isn't as healthy as I want it to be, and to be frankly, I wish I could learn    <br>
        how to cook, that way, I could stray away from purchasing fast food, which can become detrimental to   <br>
        my health.
